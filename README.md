# Node.js
In this mini project, I did Node.js and the following packages:

  In this project I;
  - Created a file named hello-world.js
  - Wrote a program to print "HELLO WORLD" to the console
  - created a server using http.createServer()
  - Wrote a program that runs on port 3030 and responds with  '<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>\n'
    when someone reaches http://localhost:3000
  - Used file system to create a file named "welcome.txt" containing one line "Hello Node".

  - Created a file named "password-generator"
